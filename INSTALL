INSTALLING
==========

Prerequisites
-------------

  CMake
    
    Lsyncd now uses CMake as configuration tool

  Common compiler stuff
   
    The C compiler, make, binutils, etc.

  Lua

    For building Lsyncd the Lua interpreter 'lua'
	and the Lua compiler 'luac' are needed.
	They aren't needed in the deployed binary though.
	
	Use Lua 5.1 or Lua 5.2 at your choice.

  Liblua

    The lua library.
	
	Note that you likely need the package "liblua-dev"
	or something like that.

	Use Lua 5.1 or Lua 5.2 at your choice.

	Note, this has to be exactly the same Version as the
	lua compiler used above!


Building
--------

  Building with a seperate build directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
	make
    sudo make install

  Building intree:
    cmake .
	make

  On OSX you yet need to get the xnu sources.
  For example:
    cmake -DWITH_INOTIFY=OFF -DWITH_FSEVENTS=ON -DXNU_DIR=/path/to/xnu-VERSION
	make

FIXME make install not yet done
