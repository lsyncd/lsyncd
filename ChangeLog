2017-01-05: 2.2.1
	enhancement: now always using filter lists with rysnc

	fix: crash due to typo in changed ^path, ^pathdir, ^pathname

2017-01-04: 2.2.0

	change: default.direct now calls copy with -p
	fix: potential race conditions:
		 default.rsyncssh will now channel deletes also through rsync and treats moves
		 as blocking events.
	fix: ']' is not escaped for rsync rules, since rsync only applies
	     doesn't applie pattern matching if no other pattern chars
		 are found.
	fix: Shell injection hole close for default.direct on mv commands. (Marcin Szewczyk)
	fix: Crash of default-direct when source doesn't exit (Michael Ploujnikov)

	     rather than filling the log crazy about it
	enhancement: rsyncOpts has been replaced by rsync = {...} parameter lists
	enhancement: default.rsyncssh has now a ssh = {...} parameter similar to default.rsync to
	             add option to ssh calls. Ditto for xargs = {...}

	             parameters to the sync{} call

		supposing 100 char width to view,
	change: Lsyncd now remembers the absolute path of its config file during HUPs
	enhancement: Defaults now respect a 'delete=false' flag when set as parameter to sync{}
		default.rsync:    does not add --delete to rsync

		 Default is "/usr/bin/rsync"
	enhancement: fsevents ("inotify for OSX") fixed for Snowleopard.
		and is available to configure by default.
