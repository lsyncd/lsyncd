NAME
----
lsyncd - a daemon to continuously synchronize directory trees 

SYNOPSIS
--------
config file:::
	{nbsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] 'CONFIG-FILE' 

default rsync behaviour:::
	{nbsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] -rsync 'SOURCEDIR' 'TARGET' ...

default rync+ssh bevahiour (moves and deletes through ssh):::
	{nbsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] -rsyncssh 'SOURCEDIR' 'TARGETHOST' 'TARGETDIR' ...

default direct bevahiour (local file operations/rsync):::
	{nbsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] -direct 'SOURCEDIR' 'TARGETDIR' ...

DESCRTIPTION
------------
Lsyncd(1) watches a local directory trees event monitor interface (inotify).
It aggregates and combines events for a few seconds and then spawns one (or
more) process(es) to synchronize the changes. By default this is rsync(1).
Lsyncd is thus a light-weight live mirror solution that is comparatively easy
to install not requiring new filesystems or blockdevices and does not hamper
local filesystem performance.

Rsync+ssh is an advanced action configuration that uses a SSH(1) to act file
and directory moves directly on the target instead of retransmitting the move
destination over the wire.

Fine-grained customizaton can be achieved through the CONFIG-FILE.  Custom
action configs can even be written from scratch in cascading layers
ranging from shell scripts to code written in the LUA(1) language.  This way
simplicity can be balanced with powerfulness.  See the online manual for
details on the CONFIG-FILE http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/wiki/Lsyncd20Manual

OPTIONS
-------
*-delay* 'SECS'::
	Overrides the default delay times.

*-help*::
	Show a help message.

*-log* 'LEVEL'::
	Controls which kind of events are logged. By default Lsyncd logs 'Normal'
	and 'Error' Messages. *-log scarce* will make Lsyncd log Error messages
	only. *-log all* will log all
	debug messages. 
	
*-log* 'Category'::
	Turns on a specific debug message. E.g. *-log Exec* will log
	all processes as they are spawned.

*-nodaemon*::
	Lsyncd will not detach from the invoker and log as well to stdout/err.

*-pifile* 'FILE'::
	Lsyncd will write its process ID in 'FILE'.

*-runner* 'FILE'::
	Makes the Lsyncd core load the part of Lsyncd written in Lua from 'FILE' 

*-version*::
	Writes version information and exits.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Terminated on a TERM signal(7)

*-1*::
	Failure (syntax, unrecoverable error condition, internal failure)
